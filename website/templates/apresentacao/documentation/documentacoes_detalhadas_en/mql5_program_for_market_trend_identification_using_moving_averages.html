    <h1>MQL5 Program for Market Trend Identification Using Moving Averages</h1>
</div>

<p>
    This is a demonstration of a program developed in MQL5 (a language semantically similar to C+) that graphically inserts moving averages of various periods into MetaTrader, allowing customization of how they are calculated. 
    For this project, a specific mathematical formula was designed to accurately classify the market status.

    <h3>Requirements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Although it is possible to compile MetaTrader on Linux using Wine, this solution still has some limitations. Therefore, we recommend using Windows when working with MQL5.</li>
        <li><strong>Mathematical Knowledge:</strong> To use the program, it is necessary to understand how to calculate different types of moving averages (exponential, simple, and weighted).</li>
    </ul>
